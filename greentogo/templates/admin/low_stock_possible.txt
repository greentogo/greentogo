Hey GreenToGo Team - 

According to the database, based on previously reported error rates, there is a possibility that {{ location.name }} could need more containers.
Their container count just reached {{ count }}, however, based on previous data, the database says:
{{ errorText }}
Meaning they could have as low as {{ badNumber }} containers.

Peace, 
The Database
